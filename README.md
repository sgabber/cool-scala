# cool-scala
A collection of code samples that show common problems solved using Scala, mostly in functional fashion.

I made this mostly for fun and for exploring scala capabilities, this code
is not thought as a single big application to run standalone.

The best you can do is to download a good scala ide
(the only one I can think of is IntelliJ)
and then run all the main methods you'll find inside the packages while watching
what the code looks like.

###Anagrams:
A program that, given a string and the path to a dictionary,
computes all the possible anagrams of the string on the dictionary.
It works by converting the words to prime numbers
(each letter is a prime number, the word is the product of the letters) 
and then

###Chess:
Common problems on the chessboard.
- **HorseMoves**: after chosing one or more starting cells the algorithm computes all the possible positions of the horse piece after a given number of turns. 

###Fizzbuzz:
Short implementation of the famous fizzbuzz test
